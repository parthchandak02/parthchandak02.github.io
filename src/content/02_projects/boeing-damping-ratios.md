Collaborated with Boeing mentor Arun Nadkarni on a critical aerospace engineering research project aimed at optimizing aircraft performance through advanced vibration analysis. The project focused on developing computational methods for accurately determining damping ratios of low frequency vibration modes in piloted aircraft systems, with the primary goal of significantly reducing required test flight time while maintaining safety and performance standards.
