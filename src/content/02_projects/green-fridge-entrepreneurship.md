Led a multidisciplinary team at the Harold Frank Engineering Entrepreneurship Institute to develop a comprehensive business plan for an innovative sustainable refrigeration system integrated with intelligent food tracking capabilities. The project combined environmental sustainability analysis with practical software development, creating both hardware specifications for energy-efficient refrigeration and a complementary Android application for food waste reduction and inventory management.
