description: 'Advanced audio analysis software utilizing Python and MATLAB for Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis, enabling detailed frequency domain analysis of audio signals.'
---

Software engineering project developed during the Crimson Code Software Hackathon at Washington State University. Created advanced audio analysis software using Python and MATLAB that analyzes audio using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) and modifies audio tone based on user preferences. The software has practical applications in the film industry, allowing audiences to customize audio intensity according to their preferences.
