Advanced prototype manufacturing project focused on designing and manufacturing a gear system for the Parallax Boe Bot used in the ENGR120 class at Washington State University. Successfully engineered a solution to increase the robot's speed by 2-6 times while maintaining the integrity of the original frame and mounting holes using 3D printing and laser cutting techniques.
